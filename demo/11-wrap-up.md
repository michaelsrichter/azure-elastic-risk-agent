# 11. Wrap-Up & Next Steps

## What We Built

This demo showcases an end-to-end AI-powered risk assessment solution:

**From Data to Insights:**
- PDFs in SharePoint → Power Automate → Azure Functions → Elasticsearch
- AI Agent with MCP tools → M365 Copilot & Teams
- Secure, extensible, and enterprise-ready architecture

**Key Technologies:**
- 🔵 **Azure AI Foundry** - Agent orchestration and GPT-4o models
- 🟡 **Elasticsearch (Azure Native ISV)** - Hybrid search with Azure OpenAI embeddings
- 🟣 **Microsoft Agent Framework** - Multi-turn conversations and tool calling
- 🔧 **Azure Functions** - Serverless document processing
- ⚡ **Power Automate** - Workflow orchestration
- 🛡️ **Azure Content Safety** - Prompt injection defense

## Key Benefits

✅ **Faster Insights** - Risk managers get instant access to document intelligence  
✅ **Data Security** - All data stays within Azure via Private Link  
✅ **Enterprise Ready** - Built on Azure's compliance and security foundation  
✅ **Cost Effective** - Unified billing through Azure Marketplace  
✅ **Extensible** - Add new data sources, tools, and agents easily
