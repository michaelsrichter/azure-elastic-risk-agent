# 3. Why Elasticsearch for Vector Search

## Elasticsearch vs. Other Vector Stores

### Why Contoso Chose Elasticsearch

Contoso selected Elasticsearch for this solution based on several key factors:

**Existing Expertise**
- Teams already proficient in Elastic for observability and log analytics
- Reduces learning curve and speeds up development
- Leverages existing operational knowledge

**Advanced AI Capabilities**
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic (vector) and keyword (BM25) search for optimal relevance
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Native support for Azure OpenAI embeddings via inference endpoints
- **semantic_text Field**: Automatic vectorization without custom embedding code
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Built-in agent builder for creating discoverable search tools

**Azure Native ISV Service**
Elasticsearch is available as an [Azure Native ISV Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/elastic/overview), providing:

- **Unified Billing**: Single invoice through Azure Marketplace, using Azure credits and commitments
- **Integrated Management**: Deploy and manage directly from Azure Portal
- **Azure Private Link**: Secure private connectivity without public internet exposure
- **Compliance**: Inherits Azure's compliance certifications and data residency requirements
- **Single Sign-On**: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) integration for unified authentication
- **Simplified Procurement**: No separate contracts or vendor relationships needed

### Benefits of This Decision

✅ **Stay Within Azure**: All infrastructure and data remains in Azure ecosystem  
✅ **Security & Compliance**: Private Link ensures data never traverses public internet  
✅ **Cost Optimization**: Use existing Azure commitments and manage through single vendor  
✅ **Operational Efficiency**: Single pane of glass for monitoring and management  
✅ **Risk Reduction**: Leverage proven expertise rather than learning new technology
