        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What is the Contoso Risk Analysis Platform?</h2>
            <p>
                CRAP is an AI-powered demonstration platform that showcases the integration of Microsoft Azure AI 
                and Elasticsearch for intelligent document analysis and risk assessment. It was built for ElasticON 
                2025 to demonstrate best practices and architectural patterns for combining these technologies.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Is this really free?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes! This is an open-source demonstration project. The code is completely free to use, modify, 
                and deploy. However, running your own instance will incur costs from the underlying Azure and 
                Elasticsearch services you use (compute, AI models, storage, etc.).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I use this for production workloads?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a demonstration project designed for learning and reference. While it showcases production-ready 
                patterns and best practices, you should carefully review and adapt the code for your specific security, 
                compliance, and scalability requirements before using it in production.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What kind of documents can I analyze?</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, the platform supports PDF documents. It extracts text from PDFs, chunks the content for 
                optimal processing, and indexes everything in Elasticsearch. The AI agent can then answer questions 
                about the document content and provide risk assessments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How does the AI agent work?</h2>
            <p>
                The platform uses Azure AI Foundry with GPT-4 models to power the conversational agent. When you ask 
                a question, the agent searches Elasticsearch for relevant document chunks using semantic search, then 
                uses that context to generate intelligent, informed responses about risk factors and compliance issues.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What is semantic search?</h2>
            <p>
                Semantic search understands the meaning and context of your query, not just keyword matching. When you 
                ask "What are the compliance risks?", the system understands you're looking for regulatory and legal 
                concerns, even if those exact words don't appear in the documents. This is powered by Azure OpenAI 
                embeddings indexed in Elasticsearch.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I use this with Microsoft Teams?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes! The solution includes a Microsoft Teams bot that provides the same risk assessment capabilities 
                directly within Teams. Check the documentation on GitHub for deployment instructions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What is Content Safety and why is it included?</h2>
            <p>
                Azure Content Safety helps ensure responsible AI usage by detecting jailbreak attempts and moderating 
                inappropriate content. It's configurable with three modes: Disabled (no checks), Audit (log but allow), 
                and Enforce (block unsafe content). This demonstrates how to build safe AI applications.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How do I deploy my own instance?</h2>
            <p>
                The repository includes Azure Developer CLI (azd) templates for easy deployment. Simply clone the repo, 
                run <code>azd auth login</code> followed by <code>azd up</code>, and the infrastructure will be 
                provisioned automatically. Check the Azure Deployment Guide in the documentation for detailed instructions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What Azure services does this use?</h2>
            <p>
                The platform uses Azure Functions (Flex Consumption), Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Azure Content 
                Safety, Azure Static Web Apps, Application Insights, and Azure Storage. All are deployed and configured 
                automatically with the azd templates.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Do I need to set up Elasticsearch myself?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you'll need an Elasticsearch cluster (either Elastic Cloud or self-hosted). The deployment guide 
                includes a script to update your Elasticsearch configuration after deploying the Azure resources. 
                Elasticsearch is not automatically provisioned by the azd templates.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How is conversation context maintained?</h2>
            <p>
                The platform maintains conversation state using thread IDs and agent IDs from Azure AI Foundry. Your 
                conversation history is preserved within a session, allowing you to ask follow-up questions and have 
                context-aware discussions about your documents.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can I customize the chunking strategy?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes! The text chunking is configurable through application settings. You can adjust chunk size, overlap, 
                and even the chunking algorithm. The platform uses a recursive text chunking service by default, but 
                you can implement your own strategy if needed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What models does it use?</h2>
            <p>
                The platform is designed to work with GPT-4 models from Azure OpenAI for the conversational agent and 
                text-embedding-ada-002 for generating embeddings for semantic search. Model selection is configurable 
                in the application settings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
