            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Contoso Risk Analysis Platform is an open-source demonstration project created for 
                ElasticON 2025. It's designed to showcase best practices and architectural patterns for 
                integrating Microsoft Azure AI services with Elasticsearch.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not a commercial product—it's a reference implementation that developers and 
                organizations can use to learn from and build upon for their own solutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Cost Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                While this demo application is free and open source, running your own instance will incur 
                costs from the underlying Azure and Elasticsearch services:
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Azure Functions:</strong> Serverless compute costs based on execution time (Flex Consumption plan)</li>
                <li><strong>Azure AI Foundry:</strong> API calls to GPT-4 models are billed per token</li>
                <li><strong>Azure OpenAI:</strong> Embedding generation for semantic search</li>
                <li><strong>Elasticsearch:</strong> Cluster hosting costs (Elastic Cloud or self-hosted)</li>
                <li><strong>Azure Storage:</strong> Minimal costs for Function App storage</li>
                <li><strong>Application Insights:</strong> Monitoring and logging costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The serverless architecture is designed to be cost-efficient, especially for development 
                and small-scale deployments. Refer to Azure and Elastic pricing calculators for specific 
                cost estimates based on your usage.
